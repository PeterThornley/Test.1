# New Project Template
This repository includes the baseline configuration artifacts for new repositories.

## Update the `README.md`

Your `README.md` should include

* An update ${year} in the copyright header
* The project name and description
* An explanation of how to setup the development environment
* Details describing how to contribute to your project

## Review `.gitignore`

Most Aucerna projects use the same languages and development environments, so a standard `.gitignore` can be shared across repositories. If required you can concatenate additional definitions for your specific project's needs.

## Other Files

* `.gitattributes` is included to ensure line endings are normalized between different development environments.
* `.editorconfig` helps to ensure developers use the same styles and conventions across projects.
